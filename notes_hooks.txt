new hooks : 
useContext

useReducer




-----------
Alternative to redux => context API
to mangage app level state in small and medium size app


In SRC new folder => context
different ressources should be broken up in differents contexts







////////////////////////////////////////////////
src/context : 
    github (folder)
        githubContext.js    // initializing a new context => see file
        githubReducer.js    // any changes made to the 'states' are going to be in here => see file
        GithubState.js      // our actions => see file
    types.js                // relevant to all the files in 'src/context/github'. 
                                types = variation of strings to call to change a state within the reducer

GithubState: include all our actions
we call an action, which make a request to github, then get a response
then we dispatch a type back to our Reducer
